# Keyboard Shortcuts

DMN Modeler, InRule Technology's DMN extension for irAuthorÂ® supports keyboard shortcuts when editing a DMN model. Keyboard shortcuts are intended to be used on the same DMN model canvas, meaning that these commands cannot be used between different DMN models.

The following key combinations can be used:

Key combination(s) | What they do
--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ctrl+C or Ctrl+Insert | Copy to the clipboard the selected elements on the canvas. When this command is applied on 2 or more shapes that are connected, by default the connection will be copied, there is no need to select it.
Ctrl+V or Shift+Insert | Paste from the clipboard previously copied or cut elements on the canvas.
Ctrl+X or Shift+Del | Cut the selected elements on the canvas. When this command is applied on a shape that is being connected to another shape, the connection will be automatically deleted after this action. When this command is applied on 2 or more shapes that are connected, by default the connection will be copied, there is no need to select it.
Del or Backspace | Deletes the selected elements. When this command is applied on a shape that is being connected to another shape, the connection will be automatically deleted also.
Ctrl+A | Select all the elements on the canvas. Reccommendation: do a mouse click somewhere on an empty space between 2 elements on the canvas prior to this keyboard shortcut; there are some empty spaces like the extreme corners of the canvas where this command doesn't work because the canvas is not activated.
Ctrl+Z or Alt+Backspace | Perform undo of the last action.
Ctrl+Y or Shift+Alt+Backspace | Perform redo of the last action.
Ctrl+(minus) | Zoom out.
Ctrl+(plus) | Zoom in.
Ctrl+0 | Reset zoom.
Shift+0 | Fit zoom on the screen. Repeat to commute between zoom to fit and normal zoom.
F2 | Enter in edit mode of the selected element.
